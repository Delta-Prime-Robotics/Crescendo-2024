# ToDo list for Pinetree

remove all beambreak code

path planner - 1) three speaker start positions ; 2) multi-note path

recalculate arm position 1) Initial shot; 2) teleop arm angles based on field location

change arm angle values to be constants instead of numbers in the code

update armposition command to use different angles

check field re-orientation parameters for the swerve gyro

Add a command to pickup note (using beam break), then immediately lift the arm to low firing position

#Autos

  Lower arm, fire (current fire only), path to a second note, run new pickup command, path to point towards speaker, fire second note
  
  Some of these will require the practice field
